**About the Project**

This project focuses on analyzing Blinkitâ€™s retail sales data to understand trends across products, outlets, customer preferences, and other performance metrics.

Using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization â€” all done inside a Jupyter Notebook.

**Tools & Technologies Used**

- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ For interactive coding and visualization  
- **Pandas** â€“ For data manipulation and aggregation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ For building detailed plots and charts  
- **NumPy** â€“ For handling numeric operations  
- **Excel (.xlsx)** â€“ Raw dataset source used in the project

**Dataset Overview**

- **Key Columns:**
  - Item attributes: `Item_Type`, `Item_Fat_Content`, `Item_MRP`, `Item_Weight`  
  - Outlet details: `Outlet_Type`, `Outlet_Size`, `Outlet_Location_Type`, `Outlet_Establishment_Year`  
  - Sales figures: `Item_Outlet_Sales` (main target variable)

**Business Problem**

Blinkit, like many retail chains, deals with a large volume of unstructured sales data. Without proper analysis, itâ€™s hard to answer key questions like:
- Which items are driving the most revenue?
- How does outlet type or location affect performance?
- Are customers leaning toward low-fat products?
- Which locations or outlet sizes need improvement?

---

**Objective of the Analysis**

The aim of this project is to:
- Understand sales distribution by item type and fat content  
- Analyze performance based on outlet size, location, and age  
- Identify customer preferences using average rating  
- Support data-driven decisions for marketing, operations, and inventory planning  

---

**What We Found**

Here are some of the key takeaways from the analysis:

- **Medium-sized outlets** performed best in terms of total sales  
- **Processed Foods** and **Snack Foods** were the most popular categories  
- Items with **low to medium fat content** generated higher revenue  
- Older outlets (established earlier) had stronger performance, suggesting customer trust and loyalty  
- Urban locations consistently recorded the highest sales volume  
- Average customer ratings were mostly positive with few low-rated products

---

**Conclusion**

This analysis helped uncover meaningful trends in Blinkit's retail operations. From identifying best-selling products to comparing outlet types and locations, the insights gained can directly support strategic decisions in inventory management, customer targeting, and outlet planning.

The project also highlights how Python and its data ecosystem can be effectively used for real-world business analysis.
